# Usage:

# You need to create a secret keyring (secring.gpg).  You can use your
# existing one, or create a new one by doing something like the
# following:

# $ GNUPGHOME=/src/debian/mini-dinstall/s3kr1t gnupg --gen-key

set -e

# Initialize GPG
gpg --help 1>/dev/null 2>&1 || true

rm -f Release.gpg.tmp
gpg --batch --default-key "${SIGNKEY}" --detach-sign -o Release.gpg.tmp "$1"
mv Release.gpg.tmp Release.gpg
